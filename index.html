          <p>
          I am a practically-minded maker of things. I tend to approach a problem with the attitude that there has to be a way to get the thing to do what I want. If that way doesn’t seem to exist, I’ll figure out how to make it. Weird things I have made include: my own drier for beef jerky, a second field in my graduate program because they didn't offer what I wanted, and a hacked radio transmitter for an iPod before iPod docks were common.</p>
          <p>My background in programming is autodidactic and mostly informal. I started out building websites for academic events using content-management systems. In many ways, this was simply an extension of my DIY ethic. I have participated in Launchcode’s CS50x and am currently attending CoderGirl.  I have also been learning Java on my own. I attended the Silver Linings Data Science and DevOps conference and go to talks and a few meetups. This list will grow as I learn more about what is available.</p>
          <p>My formal education consists of an undergraduate degree in Social Science Education, a PhD in 20th Century American History with a focus on the history of business and labor. I also have a graduate certificate in Women’s and Gender Studies. I am an organizer for the Policy History Conference. I helped create and run a National Endowment for the Humanities six-week seminar on teaching World History. I have presented at several conferences and contributed short pieces to encyclopedias in the course of my academic career.</p>

            <p><em>Map Grader</em></p>
            <p>I wrote this for a very practical reason: to save me time grading student assignments. It also gave me practice constructing a small application from scratch in Java</p>

            <p><em>Data Cleaner for Library Records</em></p>
            <p>This project is still under construction. It is part of a larger project to build a recommendation engine for history books. It takes in delimited data from a piece of freeware called MARCedit, which itself takes in MARC records from library databases. It regularizes the data for import into a Neo4j graph database</p>
